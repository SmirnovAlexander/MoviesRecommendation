Plan:
- ~~make an EDA;~~
- ~~get into the field of recommendation systems;~~
- ~~read state-of-the-art paper;~~
- ~~choose state-of-the-art solution;~~
- ~~describe chosen algorithm;~~
- **describe data preparation;**
- **describe used technologies;**
- **describe solution success measurement;**
- write chosen algorithm;
- write another algrotithm;
