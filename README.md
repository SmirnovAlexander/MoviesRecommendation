# Movies Recommendation

Recommendation system using [movie rating dataset](http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-latest-small.zip).
Movie titles are taken into account.

**Files:**
- [Exploratory data analysis](EDA.ipynb);
- [Solution description](SolutionDescription.ipynb).

Text approach **description** of building model consists of:
- argue of choices;
- algorithm description;
- working principles;
- list of used technologies & tools.

**Plan:**
- ~~make an EDA;~~
- ~~get into the field of recommendation systems;~~
- ~~read state-of-the-art paper;~~
- ~~choose state-of-the-art solution;~~
- ~~describe chosen algorithm;~~
- ~~describe data preparation;~~
- ~~describe algorithm usage;~~
- ~~describe solution success measurement.~~

**Future plans:**
- write chosen algorithm;
- write another algrotithm;
- compare & combine results.
